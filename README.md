This is the smaller version of the `electron app`. It has all the functionality,
except the drag and drop customer grid, recovery of deleted customers. There are also no settings to adjust lanes, times
and language, so there is also only a version in german. This `android app` was created to handle booking 
on the go and to be more flexible. It was designed that the `electron app` and the `android app` have the same database.
It's recommended to use something like `socket.io` to allow the use of multiple clients and a fluent flow of information.
